## ✍️ TODO
- [ ] Add MacOS support.
- [ ] Toggle tool with a shortcut (instead of copying with Cmd/Ctr+c use something else).

# Notes From the Creator [JDeeth](https://github.com/JDeeth)

## 📖 Description 

Pastegun is a script I threw together over the last couple of days. It is a magazine for your clipboard. You load in a list of things by, say, copying from Excel. Then every time you press Ctrl-V (in any window) it puts the next one into the system clipboard.

## 💪 Real Example

(It is truly magical. I put in ~200 record IDs, opened our CRM system, pressed Ctrl-V to paste the first ID, fixed the record, pressed Ctrl-V to paste the second… all without leaving the CRM system's window… and zipped through.)


## 📝 Suggestions:

- I used list+index because I couldn't figure out how to use iterators and also display the index number in the console
- possibly add hotkeys for "back" and "toggle active"
